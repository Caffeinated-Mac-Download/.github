## 🧠 What Is Caffeinated for Mac?

**Caffeinated for Mac** is a minimalist yet highly useful macOS utility that prevents your Mac from automatically going to sleep, dimming the screen, or starting the screensaver. Inspired by the original **Caffeine app for mac**, Caffeinated provides a modern alternative optimized for **macOS Big Sur**, **Monterey**, **Ventura**, **Sonoma**, and even **macOS Sequoia** with native Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) support.

This application is especially helpful when performing tasks that require your system to remain active for extended periods — such as watching long videos, running presentations, downloading large files, or during development sessions when compiling code or monitoring logs. With just a click on the menu bar icon, you can activate or deactivate the session, optionally setting custom durations (like 15 mins, 30 mins, 1 hour, or indefinitely).

Unlike more complex energy settings or terminal commands, **Caffeinated** offers a clean and elegant solution, ensuring your Mac stays on without affecting other performance settings or requiring administrator access. Its intuitive interface and minimal system resource usage make it a favorite among Mac power users.

From a technical standpoint, Caffeinated uses the `IOPMAssertion` framework from Apple, ensuring stable system-level sleep prevention. It's open source, regularly updated, and completely ad-free. The app is designed with accessibility and simplicity in mind, featuring full **macOS Dark Mode** support, Retina-optimized icons, and low CPU/memory footprint.

Whether you're presenting to a client, streaming, working remotely, or just sipping a real cup of coffee, **Caffeinated** helps your Mac match your pace — and stay awake when you need it most.
